application.py:
  * load_user()
      loads the user, returns none if not in database
  * setup_urls()
      setups all the url enpoints and titles for the navbar. It gets all "GET" registered routes from the app and filters the log/static/register/api/book endpoints out and defines the search for login only. Finally it adds the url_list to the session

      ***REMARK:** I used the nav items this way because here I only need to add/remove stuff in the forbidden and login_req lists to get the correct items in the navbar. The TA told me it was maybe easier if I did it different but since there was not much time left I could leave it like this*
  * index()
      renders the homepage (depending on login status)
  * register()
      renders the register form. If posted, it adds the user to the database
  * login()
      only if posted, it checks with database if user login details are correct. If so logs user in
  * logout()
      logout if logged in, log user out ***LOGIN REQUIRED***
  * menu()
      shows menu ***LOGIN REQUIRED***
  * add_pizza()
      returns the pizza product (Product class) for given item_id and request, if not in database it creates a new product
  * add_nonpizza()
      returns the pizza product (Product class) for given item_id and request, if not in database it creates a new product
  * shoppingcart()
      shows cart if request is a "GET" request, adds products to cart if request is "POST" request ***LOGIN REQUIRED***
  * pay_now()
      checks out all items in cart ***LOGIN REQUIRED***
  * recent()
      show the recent order history ***LOGIN REQUIRED***
  * errorhandler()
      renders error page when HTTPException is catched

requirements.txt:
  contains all modules required for app

Personal Touch:
  * My personal touch in this project is probably the way I've made sure some of the admin functions work correctly.
    Such as:
    * Only admins can reach the admin part of the website
    * If a password is changed it automatically gets hashed
    * In the products table extra cheese can only go with a non-pizza and toppings can only go with a pizza. Also a product can't have a pizza and a non-pizza at the same time.

  * I've also carefully thought through the models for this.
  An order is structured like this:

  ExampleOrder1<br>
  | OrderItem1<br>
  |...| Product1<br>
  |...|...| Pizza1<br>
  |...|...| Topping (1,2)<br>
  | OrderItem2<br>
  |...| Product2<br>
  |...|...| Non-Pizza1<br>
  |...|...| Extra cheese<br>
  | OrderItem3<br>
  |...| Product3<br>
  |...|...| Pizza1<br>
  |...|...| Topping (5,4)<br>
